# cli_test
One approach to create cli for the project using picocli.

There is a compiled version of [scheduler.jar](out/artifacts/scheduler_jar/scheduler.jar) which can be executed by providing appropriate parameters for testing. Usage is similar to what the project described:
```
java -jar scheduler.jar ...
```
